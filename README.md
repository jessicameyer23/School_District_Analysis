# School_District_Analysis
# Overview of the School District Analysis
Cheating has been suspected for 9th grade students at Thomas High School.  Therefore, the school board would like me to remove the 9th grade math and reading scores from the school data and re-run the school district analysis.  I will also analyze how removing those scores affects the statistics.  The 9th grade students only made up approximately 1% of the total students, so I wouldn't expect the scores and statistics to change significantly.  

# Results

**1.  District Summmary:**
At a rounded data level, the district summary numbers do not appear to have changed.  This is because of the large amount of students in the district.  However, when analyzing the district summary numbers with more decimals included in the images, as shown below, the numbers do change.  At a district level, the average math score went down slightly from 78.985371 to 78.93053 and the average reading score also went down slightly from 81.87784 to 81.8558.  See image support below.
