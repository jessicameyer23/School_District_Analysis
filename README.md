# School_District_Analysis
# Overview of the School District Analysis
Cheating has been suspected for 9th grade students at Thomas High School.  Therefore, the school board would like me to remove the 9th grade math and reading scores from the school data and re-run the school district analysis.  I will also analyze how removing those scores affects the statistics.  The 9th grade students only made up approximately 1% of the total students, so I wouldn't expect the scores and statistics to change significantly.
